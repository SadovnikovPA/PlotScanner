Detects A4 sheet of paper on plane surface then extacts plot points from it and constructs a plot. This is test project for practice, so lots of unnecessary code here. Consider using opencv for real problems. Requirements: numpy, PIL-Pillow. Set of tesing images can be found here: https://yadi.sk/d/tT4fJ9k9kyzun Expected result: https://yadi.sk/d/beqqjP25kyzw6
